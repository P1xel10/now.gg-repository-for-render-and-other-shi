CybriaGG is an archive now which sucks. (check out their other repos!!!)
This probably means that this repo doesn't work anymore, cause I synced everything.
I'm making a new repo (with a friend of mine,) which you can see as a fused and better version of this repo. -- > [ITS IN PROGRESS]

That's all I gotta say. I'm not apart of their group or anything but they work really hard so please check them out here --> https://github.com/CybriaTech
